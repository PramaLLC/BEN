## Overview
BEN (Background Erase Network) introduces a novel approach to foreground segmentation through its innovative Confidence Guided Matting (CGM) pipeline. The architecture employs a refiner network that targets and processes pixels where the base model exhibits lower confidence levels, resulting in more precise and reliable matting results.

This repository provides the official evaluation for our model, as detailed in our research paper: [BEN: Background Erase Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06230).



## BEN2 Access
BEN2 is now publicly available, trained on DIS5k and our 22K proprietary segmentation dataset. Our enhanced model delivers superior performance in hair matting, 4K processing, object segmentation, and edge refinement.
